# 🗂️ Flask TaskManager

![Dashboard Preview](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

## 📌 Project Description

**Flask TaskManager** is a classic CRUD application built to manage user tasks. While the concept may be simple, the **implementation is robust and production-ready**, with a strong focus on **security**, **modular design**, and **scalability**.

🔐 The app implements advanced security and access management features:

- ⚙️ Jinja2 templating — dynamic view rendering and safe code injection
- 🧑‍⚖️ Role-based access — anonymous users, authenticated users, and admins
- 🔐 View protection — decorators and route-based permissions
- 🔑 Strong password policy + custom validation rules
- 🛡️ Protection against:
  - SQL injection (SQLAlchemy + Flask-WTF)
  - CSRF attacks (Flask-WTF with tokens)
  - XSS scripting (Flask-WTF + Jinja2 escaping)
  - Brute-force & DoS attacks (Flask-Limiter[redis])
- 💾 Secure sessions via HTTP-only cookies
- 🌐 HTTP header hardening + forced HTTPS (Flask-Talisman):
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Referrer-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options

🧯 Built-in error pages for:
- 403 — Forbidden Access  
- 404 — Page Not Found  
- 500 — Internal Server Error  

...all styled with user-friendly graphical templates.

The project supports full task and user management, including role assignment, session management, access control, and administrator dashboards.
